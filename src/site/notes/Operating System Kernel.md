# Operating System Kernel

An operating system kernel is the core of an Operating System. 

Examples:

- [[Linux]] 
- Windows NT
- XNU

Generally, you cannot use a kernel directly since you need an OS, i.e. a software which will mediate communication between you and the kernel. 

Example:
- Ubuntu mediates between you and Linux.
- Windows mediates between you and Windows NT.
- MacOS mediates between you and XNU.
