# Flutter

Flutter is a [[opensource]] framework to build multi-platform (primarily mobile) apps.

You can use Flutter to build Mobile, Desktop and Web apps (Using [[WebAssembly]]).

It uses the Dart programming language.

Flutter apps are natively compiled, so it's fast. They ship with the runtime included, which makes it big in size, but robust and reliable.
