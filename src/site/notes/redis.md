# Redis

Redis is an open-source in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database,
cache, and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists,
sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with
radius queries, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction,
transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability
via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
