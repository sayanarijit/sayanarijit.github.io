## My Experience

GTD is the first self-organisation method I tried, and I highly recommend it for people without any prior knowledge/experince of such concepts.
It helped getting things back on track multiple times when I felt overwhelmed.
It also helped me create and maintain this website which earned me some heart warming "thank you"s from nice strangers, and got me noticed by interesting people and having life changing conversations with them.

However, I was failing to do the daily and weekly routines that are super important to stay on track, as they felt optional to me, and often ended up with anxiety-causing huge pile of quick notes in my "imbox".

Having an "imbox" to quickly dump notes, while feels nice and assuring, the lack of "do date" in those notes makes me (subconsciously) feel that daily/weekly maintenance are optional (a burden). So I decided to give [[PPV]] a try.
