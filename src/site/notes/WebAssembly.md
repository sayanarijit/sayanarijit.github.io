# WebAssembly

WebAssembly was supposed to be a saviour for the web developers (like [[Rust]] is a saviour for the system developers) by ridding them of the horrors of JavaScript and [[TypeScript gotchas]]. But so far, it hasn't succeeded, and people still _Always bet on JavaScript_.

However, there are scenarios on the web where WebAssembly is more suitable. For e.g. online games, photo editors etc. i.e. web apps with logic complex enough for JavaScript to hack.

Also, WebAssembly has managed to find plenty of use cases outside Web (e.g. embedded configuration language) and is thriving in the multi-platform space (e.g. [[Flutter]]).
