# Software Development

For me, software development is the most exciting part of [[programming]].

It is different from [[software engineering]] but in practice, the distinction often gets blurry.

There are many ways to develop software. Most popular of them are:

- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
- Domain Driven Development (DDD)
