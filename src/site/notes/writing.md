## Non Technical

### How to find dialogues?

Can you recall witnessing a memorable incident?
Maybe someone saved a kid from an accident. Have you found yourself imagining how you'd respond if you were the victim or the hero?
What you'd say to each other?
If yes, do you recall placing yourself in someone else's shoe and imagine similar things?
If yes, write them down.

### Concepts

See [[concepts]].

    - Write first. Edit, spellcheck, improve, revise later.

### The writers pyramid

- Those who want to write, think they have a book inside
- Those who take initiative to learn writing (üôã me)
- Those who write the first novel
- Those who write another
- Those who get published
- Those who get published again and again
- The real fortune
