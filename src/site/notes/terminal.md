# Terminal

Terminal is where the average backend developers and system engineers live.

Related terms (not necessarily the same):

- Shell
- Command-line
- Console
- TUI

Shell is a program in an [[Operating System]] using which users can interact with the [[Operating System Kernel]] by typing keys in the keyboard.

Command-line or rather, Command-line interface is the interface that defines the rules of interaction.

Console is now synonymous with the word "terminal", but back in the days, it meant a different thing. I'm not a history person, so doesn't matter to me.

TUI is an interesting one. It provides a real-time user interface (UI) in the terminal, similar to GUI (Graphical User Interface), but with primary focus on being keyboard-controlled as opposed to being mouse dependent. Hence, some TUI programs can be extremely productive than their GUI counterparts, for people who lives on the terminal btw.

Most terminals and terminal programs come with a configuration system that can be synced using the [[dotfiles]] system.

Some of the most popular terminals are:

- Kitty
- iTerm & iTerm2
- Alacritty
- Wezterm
- Windows Terminal
- Gnome Shell
- Konsole
