### How to find dialogues?

Can you recall witnessing a memorable incident?
Maybe someone saved a kid from an accident. Have you found yourself imagining how you'd respond if you were the victim or the hero?
What you'd say to each other?
If yes, do you recall placing yourself in someone else's shoe and imagine similar things?
If yes, write them down.
