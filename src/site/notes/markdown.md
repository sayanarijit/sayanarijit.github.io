# Markdown

Markdown is a language that makes it easy to write nicely formatted (rich) text. It's easy to learn and looks nice even without any syntax highlighting.

It converts to HTML. So, most [[static site generator]]s support markdown, many as its primary data format.

It is also used for writing:

- books
- research papers
- documentation
- technical specification
- Wiki
- [[digital garden]]s

If you are a professional or hobbyist who writes a lot, learning this will benefit you.
