# Concepts

Every now and then, I wonder "what if there was a reality like this?". For a long time, I wanted to do something about those thoughts. But not knowing exactly what to do, I've been discarding those thoughts and I regret everytime I did that.

I still don't know what to do with them, but I feel something of value might come out of them someday if I write them down and wait. So here they are.

Feel free to steal, but please share with me what you come up with.

## Writing

### Character

<details>
  <summary>Detached Genius</summary>

A genius who cannot answer a single history question. "Is past really important?" he asks.

</details>

### Plot

<details>
  <summary>Artist's Pain</summary>

He started drawing. Looks like a face. A face so miserable. Looks like the face is covered with tears. No these aren't actually tears, these are actually abandoned memories. With each line the misery of the face just keeps growing. He's ruthless. He's so cruel. How can someone draw a face so painfully miserable? Wait, why did he keep his forehead on the face he just drew? Does the face resemble someone he knew? No I don't think someone could ever exist with this much misery inside. Did he draw the face because it's the only thing that could understand him, even if it's just an imagination? I can't understand. He just punched a hole in the forehead of the face he drew, using the tip of the pencil. It's horrible. But I'm not sure why I feel so relieved. The face looks a bit relieved too. He looks a bit sad, but relieved too.

  <summary>Selfish Me</summary>

He doesn't cry. But if he ever does, he doesn't like others to see his tears. He'd do anything to hide them. But if he hides his eyes, he can't keep an watch on me. He doesn't know what I might end up doing. He doesn't understand me. He doesn't understand any of what's happening. Not even why his eyes are begging to let it all out. All he knows at the moment is that he needs to keep me in his blurry sight at any cost, while I'm still standing frozen, facing towards the door in close proximity, staring downwards, probably crying too.
