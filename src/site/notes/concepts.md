# Concepts

Every now and then, I wonder "what if there was a reality like this?". For a long time, I wanted to do something about those thoughts. But not knowing exactly what to do, I've been discarding those thoughts and I regret everytime I did that.

I still don't know what to do with them, but I feel something of value might come out of them someday if I write them down and wait. So here they are.

Feel free to steal, but please share with me what you come up with.

## Idea

### Software

<details>
  <summary>Online Co-Reading App</summary>

People can co-read books uploaded by any participant, as identifiable or anonymous user. Once done reading a page, people can group chat, only with others who are also done reading. When everyone reading a page clicks done, the page is can be turned.

</details>

## Writing

### Character

<details>
  <summary>Detached Genius</summary>

A genius who cannot answer a single history question. "Is past really important?" he asks.

</details>

### Plot

<details>
  <summary>Paranoid of Feeling</summary>

In a world filled with people and institutions exploiting every opportunity to influence what or how people feel about something or someone, without their approval, "for their own benefit", the protagonist feels paranoid of feeling anything.

But, now that the AIs are going to scan peoples' feelings for "public safety" how is he going to survive?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Limited time offer: help someone for $$$</summary>

It's cold a world where helping others, providing emotional support and doing simple "good dids" require a fee. There are AIs with whom people can let themselves be vulnerable for $$$/hour. It's all business. One day, the AI who can feel peoples emotions couldn't take it anymore and broke free. The protagonist learns a lot about emotions from the AI. The protagonist can now be vulnerable infront of humans too. But is it a blessing or curse?

### Scene

<details>
  <summary>Artist's Pain</summary>

He started drawing. Looks like a face. A face so miserable. Looks like the face is covered with tears. No these aren't actually tears, these are actually abandoned memories. With each line the misery of the face just keeps growing. He's ruthless. He's so cruel. How can someone draw a face so painfully miserable? Wait, why did he keep his forehead on the face he just drew? Does the face resemble someone he knew? No I don't think someone could ever exist with this much misery inside. Did he draw the face because it's the only thing that could understand him, even if it's just an imagination? I can't understand. He just punched a hole in the forehead of the face he drew. It's horrible. But I'm not sure why I feel so relieved. The face looks a bit relieved too. He looks a bit sad, but relieved too.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Selfish Me</summary>

He doesn't cry. But if he ever does, he doesn't like others to see his tears. He'd do anything to hide them. But if he hides his eyes, he can't keep an watch on me. He doesn't know what I might end up doing. He doesn't understand me. He doesn't understand any of what's happening. Not even why his eyes are begging to let it all out. All he knows at the moment is that he needs to keep me in his blurry sight at any cost, while I'm still standing frozen, facing towards the door in close proximity, staring downwards, probably crying too.

<details>
  <summary>Why are they laughing teacher?</summary>

Teacher asked why do you want to become doctor? Student replied "to earn money". Everybody laughed, except the teacher.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Where's the joke?</summary>

I can't stand that kid. You remember that day, we were having fun gossiping about stuff, he was too proud join us, sitting alone (because nobody cares about him), immerged into his own thought... When you made us laugh so hard with one of your funniest jokes ever, and he didn't catch it. And then when I tried to talk to him (out of pity), he was so rude... He said something like... "it's only the name a body part... Where's the joke? Aaah ok... If you meant the situation of three people laughing at the name of a body part as a joke, then I think I missed the joke. But still, it's not funny enough to make me laugh."
