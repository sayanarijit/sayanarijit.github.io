# ü¶Ä Rust

It's 2022 and Rust is still on a spree, ranking at the top as the world's most loved programming language, in a popular survey conducted by https://stackoverflow.com.

Rust is a saviour for the `C` and `C++` developers about to jump off the window due to frustration causing from countless bugs, memory leaks and hellish dependency management system.

But for me, Rust just has my favourite type system and [[functional programming]]-like APIs with a divine philosophy (the Zen of Python[^1] done right) for a general purpose programming language.
