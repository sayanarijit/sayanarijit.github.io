- "You should die naked. If you're still bothered by what other people will think of you, then you can't die just yet" ~ Ryuji Ayukawa.

- "There's no need to unnecessary new-ness. Most people crave for 'familiar'" ~ (TODO find source).

- "Don't lose sight of youself" ~ Everyone

- "When you ask a dumb question, you might get a smart, unexpected answer" ~ James Scott Bell

- "Meaningful life" is subjective. But "The meaning of life" is objective. Living a "meaningful life" is an aspect of living a good life, or of well-being, which some achieve and others don't, to differing degrees. If there is a "meaning of life", it would be a single meaning that applies to everyone.

- The purpose of life might be to ultimately figure out the purpose of life collectively.
