- "You should die naked. If you're still bothered by what other people will think of you, then you can't die just yet" ~ Ryuji Ayukawa.

- "Meaningful life" is subjective. But "The meaning of life" is objective. Living a "meaningful life" is an aspect of living a good life, or of well-being, which some achieve and others don't, to differing degrees. If there is a "meaning of life", it would be a single meaning that applies to everyone.

- The purpose of life might be to ultimately figure out the purpose of life collectively.

- Randy Pausch's Last Lecture: https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/

- If you are confused about how you want to live, focus on how you want to die.

- If there was an objective meaning of life, we wouldn't be free, we'd work like robots and compete with each other to fulfill that single meaning more than the others - [[Naval Ravikant]]: https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44 Skip to 1:36:08

- If you're doing something you like, wear something different, be unique, be creative, express yourself.

- If you want something, before aquiring it, ask yourself... Will it make you happier in life? Once you get it, would you really cherish it for the rest of your life, even if you don't get to show it off to other people?

- Develop a third eye for detecting distracting information. Be aware of the distractions. Keep a record of what distracted you throughout the day. Review weekly or monthly and optimize. Even relevant information can be irrelevant at the wrong time. Optimize how to handle them.

- Keep a record of what you own and why. Everything you own came with attached responsibilities. Identify them. Learn them. Maintain them.

- Be aware of when you are rushing but getting nowhere. It's usually when you want to just get things done, and when things turn out hairy, you feel annoyed instead of feeling curious and excited. Or when you are unable to get bored, or when you feel asleep while reading a book. Recognise, slow down and take back control. Hairy things should excite you, not annoy you. Everyone driving a car doesn't mean you are slower on your feet.

- Digest the information you have on your plate for now. Don't over consume.

- Block sources of information. Only seek information when you're done with the current ones. There's no point in playing the busy man schedule.

- Stop reading "how to"s. If you genuinely want to do something, start doing it, you'll it figure it out. If you don't, trying to execute "how to"s you've read will only bring you pain and suffering.

- Procrastination starts with dishes in the basin. There shouldn't be any list without a TTL.

- When you're up against stereotypical stupidity, just change the perspective. Jump one dimension up.

- "you're missing out" is the ultimate weapon most scammers use to convince you.

- There's no enemy, [only fellow hedgehogs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/science-and-philosophy/202003/the-hedgehog-s-dilemma).

- Avoid clutter. Avoid putting everything into mobile. Try to take things out of mobile and put them into some physical space, somewhere they should belong. Those things should be visible only when you're near that physical space. You should be able to leave that space without leaving your mobile.

- Avoid making relationships with brands. Brand to person relationships are mostly one sided, with the brand having unfair advantages. Either person to person, or brand to brand relationship works best.

- When it comes to questions related to survival, don’t ask. Observe. Questions like “how to make money”, “how to land a job”, “how to get promoted”. When you ask, you become their customer.

- Having failure as an option is luxury.

- When dealing with personal favour requests from others, to decide whether “should I (help)”, first ask yourself “would I (ask for help in this situation).

- Philosophers are a bunch of lazya\*\* people who waste their life looking for the easiest way to live a fulfilling life.

## We all are Hypocrites

Before acting all wise, remember your forgotten foolishness. Remember the dark memories that you are keeping hidden from yourself. You were someone you truly resent now.

## Mental Health

Life where you don't desire anything, is depression.

## Ethics

- "Morality is not some objective truth. It's a skill that we develop as we progress both individually as a human and collectively as mankind." ~ ???

> Feelings have a judgement inside. Virtue is having correct judgements about the world, be it good or bad.
