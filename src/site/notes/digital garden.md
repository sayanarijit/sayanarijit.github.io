# Digital Garden

One's digital garden[^1] is a place to dump and organise their personal knowledge in written format.

Related terms are:

- Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)
- Zettelkasten
- Second Brain[^3]
- Knowledge Graph
- Mind Garden[^2]

It can be used to:

- Dump things, you think might be useful someday in the future.
- Dump interesting thoughts and personal take on things you encounter.
- Link related chunks of knowledge and find some meaning.
- Brainstorm new ideas by exploring things, taking notes and finding interconnections.
- Take things off of your primary brain.
- Reflect upon your interests and motivations.

This is my digital garden built using [[eleventy-garden]].

## Alternative to School System?

Just a thought, but what if everyone, instead of learning the same syllabus and competing against each other
with the same knowledge base, build their own digital garden by following wherever their own interests
lead them to? Could we fix the lack of talent pool and the rise of unemployment this way?
