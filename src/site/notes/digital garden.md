# Digital Garden

One's digital garden[^1] is a place to dump and organise their personal knowledge in written format.

Related terms are:

- Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)
- Zettelkasten
- Second Brain
- Knowledge Graph
- Mind Garden[^2]

It can be used to:

- Dump things, you think might be useful someday in the future.
- Dump interesting thoughts and personal take on things you encounter.
- Link related chunks of knowledge and find some meaning.
- Brainstorm new ideas by exploring things, taking notes and finding interconnections.
- Take things off of your primary brain.
- Reflect upon your interests and motivations.

This is my digital garden built using [[eleventy-garden]].
