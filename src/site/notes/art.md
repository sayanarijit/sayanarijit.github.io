# Art

For me, [[programming]] is an art.

All I know about art is:

- Art can be defined as the synchronization of the oscillating frequencies of the universe. For e.g. melodies synchronize just like the patterns of a snowflakes.
- It's possible that art is very close to [[Mathematics]], specifically "Chaos theory"[^1].
