Learn this if:

- You are overwhelmed with incoming information.
- Your to-do list hopelessly long and it's getting worse.
- You are overworked, burnt out or exhausted.
- You are not sure if you are doing the right thing.
- You are wondering about your [[life]]'s purpose and meaning.
- You want a system to manage work and life together.
- And [[GTD]] is not working for you.
